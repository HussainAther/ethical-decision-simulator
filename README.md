# Ethical Decision-Making Simulator

## Overview

The Ethical Decision-Making Simulator is an innovative VR tool that immerses students in realistic scenarios, challenging them to make complex ethical decisions. By analyzing student choices and providing feedback, the simulator helps students develop empathy, integrity, and nuanced ethical reasoning skills. With branching scenarios, role-based perspectives, and AI-driven decision analysis, the tool offers a unique learning experience that prepares students for real-world ethical challenges.

## Key Features

- **Branching Scenarios with Real-Time Feedback**: Scenarios dynamically change based on student choices, showing immediate consequences and ethical considerations.
- **AI Decision Analysis**: The AI system tracks decision patterns, analyzing reasoning and providing feedback to encourage ethical understanding.
- **Role-Based Perspectives**: Students can view scenarios from different roles, such as a doctor, patient, or family member, promoting empathy and perspective-taking.
- **Adaptive Feedback**: Personalized guidance helps students reflect on their choices and improve their ethical reasoning skills.

## Impact

This simulator equips students with critical thinking and ethical decision-making skills by immersing them in challenging, real-world scenarios. Through adaptive, interactive learning, students gain deeper insights into ethical considerations and develop the ability to make thoughtful decisions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the Ethical Decision-Making Simulator, you will need:

- **Python 3.8+**
- **VR Platform** (Optional, for full VR integration): Unity or Unreal Engine
- **Python Libraries**:
  - `transformers`: For AI analysis of student decisions
  - `json` and `matplotlib`: For scenario data and visualization of decision paths

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ethical-decision-simulator.git
   cd ethical-decision-simulator
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Install required Python packages:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

## Usage

### 1. Running a Scenario

Start a scenario by loading a JSON scenario file and walking through decisions. Each choice affects the next step, creating a personalized path for each user.

```python
from scenarios.branching_logic import Scenario

scenario = Scenario("scenarios/scenario_example.json")
scenario.start_scenario()
scenario.make_choice(0)  # Replace with actual choice index
```

### 2. Analyzing Decisions with AI

Use the AI decision analyzer to assess a student's reasoning based on their text input or voice response.

```python
from ai_analysis.decision_analysis import DecisionAnalyzer

analyzer = DecisionAnalyzer()
feedback = analyzer.analyze_decision("I will tell the patient about all risks.")
print("AI Feedback:", feedback)
```

### 3. Switching Perspectives

Allow students to view the scenario from different perspectives (e.g., doctor, patient, family member) to develop empathy.

```python
from perspectives.role_perspective import RolePerspective

role_view = RolePerspective("doctor")
role_view.display_perspective()
```

### 4. Generating Personalized Feedback

Provide students with feedback based on their emotional state and decision quality.

```python
from feedback.guidance import FeedbackGenerator

feedback_gen = FeedbackGenerator()
feedback_gen.generate_feedback("frustration", "good")
```

---

## VR Integration (Optional)

For a fully immersive experience, integrate the simulator with Unity or Unreal Engine. VR enables students to engage with scenarios more interactively, enhancing empathy and emotional engagement.

1. **Unity Setup**: Import Python scripts as plugins or use a Python interpreter compatible with Unity.
2. **Unreal Engine Setup**: Integrate AI models and scenario branching through Blueprint or C++ and connect them to the VR environment.
